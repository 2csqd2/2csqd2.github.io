### 3/5/2020
After Lachelle pickup Tyler from Gymnastics practice she dropped him off at 8:45pm. She left the house with telling me anything and returned home at 5:07am. I turned off the garage door opener on  purpose to make sure the Ring would capture her if and when she returned.  She stayed out with Phil all night, and didn't understand the basic optics of it (a married women spending the night with a man who is not her husband).  She claimed nothing happened, and they for drinks and then to a cigar bar.

### 3/14/2020
I picked up Palmer's bike helmet, a clothes rack, and Tyler's bike at two different Target stores @ 8am.  I helped Tyler build his bike an played with Palmer, Harper, and Tyler outside with Eric and Anne (along w/ their childern) until approx. 11am. 

### 3/15/2020
I woke up at 8am and made pancakes and eggs for the children for breakfast.  Lachelle woke up at about 9:30 and came out of her bed room at 9:500am.  I then started moving contents from my (former) closet to the closet rack I purchased from Target and placed in the basement office (my new room), completed.  Lachelle came to me ay about 1pm asking who I told about our separation and ask me not to speak about it for a few months.  She also started talking about dates... I wasn't following at first, but she discussed the date we had the fight as the separation date.  I agreed and made a calendar appointment  for the *1 March 2020*, as "Agreed Upon First Date of Separation."  I went upstairs in the kitchen and sweep the floor to get away from any further communication. I went outside and played with Palmer and Harper for about an hour.  Then, Palmer, Harper, and I made chocolate chip and pecan cookies.  I went back outside and played baseball with Palmer, Harper, and Tyler for about 30 minutes.  Lachelle watched a movie in the basement with the lights off.

### 3/16/2020
I woke up at 6:30 and so did Palmer.  We ate breakfast together.  Everyone stayed at home today because of the "social distance" closing of the school system and businesses.  Harper woke up a little later and fixed breakfast herself, and then setup her Chromebook and school work printouts.  I went through a page of word questions and vocabulary "homophones."  Lachelle and I switched helping the kids with homework, checking their progress, and playing with them outside, while doing work ourselves.

### 3/17/2020
I woke up at 6:30 am along with Palmer.  He asked me if today was a school day.  I told him "no" and for him to go back to sleep.  I left for work shortly after that and returned home at about 4:30pm.  I texted Lachelle in the middle of the day to see how the kids were behaving and to ask if their were any essentials needed from the store.  Lachell made Shepard's Pie for the kids dinner.  I made a salad about 30 minutes after everyone else ate.  I gave Palmer a bath at about 7:30-7:45pm.

She didn't come back until 5:15 pm.  I was only planning to take a half day off work, but I had no choice since she didn't return around the pre-commmunicated time.  Anyways...  I monitored their home school work and adherance to their schedule (Corona virus quaratine).  I made peanut butter and jelly sandwichs with carrots &blue cheese dressing for lunch.  

### 3/20/2020

I returned home at 4:15 pm.  I got the kids ready for bed after Lachelle spent most of the evening organizing her bedroom.  She told me she would be visiting a friend in Richmond Saturday and wouldn't be here.

### 3/21/2020

The kids and I played indoor games downstairs, watched a  movie and then had hotdogs and turkey sandwiches for lunch.  We then went outside and played tag, skateboard, etc. off and on until it got dark. Tyler went to play with Justin from 4-6pm.  The kids ate leftovers for dinner. Lachelle returned at about 12:30am.

I woke up at 5am and left for work at 5:30am went to work. I returned home at 430pm, Lachelle told me she was taking a nap as soon as I arrived. I made dinner for Harper and Palmer and I at 6pm.  At around 10pm, Lachelle cam down to the office and asked me for my car keys., stating that she needed to go take a drive.  I put everyone to bed at 1030pm and went to sleep.

I woke up at 730am, called Lachelle's number (no answer), then texted her asking whether I needed to report my car stolen ~

I ate breakfast and then Harper woke-up so I helped her get cereal.  I then unloaded the dishwasher and did another load of dishes before going down stairs to help Harper put together a puzzle.
