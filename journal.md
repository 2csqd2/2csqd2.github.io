### 3/5/2020
After Lachelle pickup Tyler from Gymnastics practice she dropped him off at 8:45pm. She left the house with telling me anything and returned home at 5:07am. I turned off the garage door opener on  purpose to make sure the Ring would capture her if and when she returned.  She stayed out with Phil all night, and didn't understand the basic optics of it (a married women spending the night with a man who is not her husband).  She claimed nothing happened, and they for drinks and then to a cigar bar.

### 3/15/2020
I woke up at 8am and made pancakes and eggs for the children for breakfast.  Lachelle woke up at about 9:30 and came out of her bed room at 9:500am.  I then started moving contents from my (former) closet to the closet rack I purchased from Target and placed in the basement office (my new room), completed.  Lachelle came to me ay about 1pm asking who I told about our separation and ask me not to speak about it for a few months.  She also started talking about dates... I wasn't following at first, but she discussed the date we had the fight as the separation date.  I agreed and made a calendar appointment  for the *1 March 2020*, as "Agreed Upon First Date of Separation."  I went upstairs in the kitchen and sweep the floor to get away from any further communication. I went outside and played with Palmer and Harper for about an hour.  Then, Palmer, Harper, and I made chocolate chip and pecan cookies.  I went back outside and played baseball with Palmer, Harper, and Tyler for about 30 minutes.  Lachelle watched a movie in the basement with the lights off.
