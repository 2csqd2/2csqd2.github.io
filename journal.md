## February 2020
### 2/29/2020
Lachelle and I had a big fight about a camp brochure which escalated.  I slept on the couch in the basement that night and never returned to the bedroom.  I was tired of being disrespected and she was nolonger worth any of my effort to even get upset. 

## March 2020
### 3/5/2020
After Lachelle pickup Tyler from Gymnastics practice she dropped him off at 8:45pm. She left the house without telling me anything and returned home at 5:07am. I turned off the garage door opener on  purpose to make sure the Ring(alarm system) would capture her if and when she returned.  She stayed out with Phil all night, and didn't understand the basic optics of it (a married women spending the night with a man who is not her husband).  She claimed nothing happened, and they went for drinks and then to a cigar bar.  I slept on the couch in the basement.

### 3/14/2020
I picked up Palmer's bike helmet, a clothes rack, and Tyler's bike at two different Target stores @ 8am.  I helped Tyler build his bike an played with Palmer, Harper, and Tyler outside with Eric and Anne (along w/ their childern) until approx. 11am. I built the clothes rack and put it in the office.  Later on that afternoon I finished moving all of my clothes out of the closet into the office. I slept in the office on a floor cushion.

### 3/15/2020 *****
I woke up at 8am and made pancakes and eggs for the children for breakfast.  Lachelle woke up at about 9:30 and came out of her bed room at 9:500am.  I then started moving contents from my (former) closet to the closet rack I purchased from Target and placed in the basement office (my new room), completed.  Lachelle came to me ay about 1pm asking who I told about our separation and ask me not to speak about it for a few months.  She also started talking about dates... I wasn't following at first, but she discussed the day we had the fight as the separation date, although we hadn't talked about separation until two weeks later. I think she wanted to try to cover herself for the date she consumated her new relationship.  Anyway, I told her I agreed to the date and made a Google calendar appointment  for the *1 March 2020*, as "Agreed Upon First Date of Separation."  I went upstairs in the kitchen and sweep the floor to get away from any further communication. I went outside and played with Palmer and Harper for about an hour.  Then, Palmer, Harper, and I made chocolate chip and pecan cookies.  I went back outside and played baseball with Palmer, Harper, and Tyler for about 30 minutes.  Lachelle watched a movie in the basement with the lights off.  I slept in the office on a floor cushion.

### 3/16/2020
I woke up at 6:30 and so did Palmer.  We ate breakfast together.  Everyone stayed at home today because of the "social distance" closing of the school system and businesses.  Harper woke up a little later and fixed breakfast herself, and then setup her Chromebook and school work printouts.  I went through a page of word questions and vocabulary "homophones."  Lachelle and I switched helping the kids with homework, checking their progress, and playing with them outside, while doing work ourselves.

I texted Lachelle in the middle of the day to see how the kids were behaving and to ask if their were any essentials needed from the store.  Lachelle made Shepard's Pie for the kids dinner.

She didn't come back until 5:15 pm.  I was only planning to take a half day off work, but I had no choice since she didn't return around the pre-commmunicated time.  Anyways...

At noon I instructed Tyler on how to make waffle/pancake batter since he wanted waffles.  I then made hot dogs for lunch for Harper and Palmer.  I played with Harper and Palmer off and on until dinner. Lachelle returned at about 7 pm.  I made gumbo in the pressure cooker so there would be food for a few days in the refridgerator.  

### 3/29/2020
I woke up at 8am and made coffee. Harper and Palmer woke up by 8:30am and then I made waffles with them.  At about 10am I started inflating balloons to put on my car for the drive-by birthday party of Palmer's friend, Grayson. At 10:30am I went outside and taped a "happy birthday" banner and about 12 balloons to my truck.  At 11am, after insisting that all of us go around the corner to wish him happy birthday, everyone got in the truck and I downloaded a birthday song to play for Grayson as we arrived at his house.  

### 3/30/2020
I woke up at 5am after hearing someone awake upstairs.  I left for work at 5:30am.  Lachelle sent me a text asking what time I would be returning, since she had some errands to run.

## April 2020
### 4/1/2020
I woke up around 2:20am after hearing walking around upstairs and checked to see if it was the kids.  It was Lachelle.  I went back to sleep and woke up at 4:30am when Palmer walked down stairs into the office and said he couldn't sleep.  I told hime to go get in his mother's bed.  He went back to sleep until 8am when I woke up.  I made coffee, sat in the kitchen for a while.  I then played one game of indoor volleyball with Palmer.  I told Lachelle that I would be returning at 5:15pm in case she needed to plan her "soiree" right before I left for work at 9am.  I returned home at 4:30. Harper, Palmer, and I made homemade pizza with a dough kit I bought the day before.  Since Tyler had two matresses on his bed, I burrowed one, putting it in the office and slept on that instead of the floor.

### 4/2/2020
I woke up around 8:30am and stayed at home today.  For lunch I made PB&J sandwiches.  After lunch, Harper, Palmer, and I made bread dough for 2 loafs.  Then we let the dough sit while the finished their school work. I made a mexican pizza which Harper and I ate for dinner. Lachelle made a tuna caserole which Palmer and Tyler ate.  Lachelle talked to loudly on the phone in the bedroom (above the office) until 12:30am, interrupting my sleep.  I heard her say she "would be alright, and that she had plenty of boose and pills if she needed them," to whomever she was speaking with on the phone.  

[Abnormal amount, usually one or two bottles of wine. In addition she bought another bottle of something dark and two cases of beer](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yFgfLU9Ovnx4p_yO3M2DPdOHkvraRTQP)

### 4/3/2020
I woke at 5am and left for work by 5:30am.  Palmer, Harper, and I made a batch of dough and made a homemade pizza for dinner with peas and put two batches of dough in the refridgerator for later in the week.  Tyler had leftover Popeyes that I brought home from lunch. Lachelle said she needed to "go for a drive," and left at 5:45pm.  I turned the alarm on shortly after knowing that she would be back in the morning.  Before bed, Harper asked me "where is Mommy," I told her I didn't know.

### 4/4/2020
I had a unexpected visitor in the fron of the house last night.  Usually its a heard of deer, but this time it was an older man stumbling...he was not one of the neighbors and he did not drive up. I didn't hear any of this when it happened between 4:10 and 4:20 am.  I saw it when I went to check the cameras for adding timelines to my journal.  This is just another example of what the only adult in the house must consider in keeping his family safe and healthy.

I woke up at 8:30am and made toast and jelly for Palmer, and a bagel for Harper. Harper asked me again "where is Mommy," I told her I didn't know.  Lachelle returned at 8:53am (see below) and went to take a shower (I stayed in the office updating this journal).

[Walk out of garage](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11tDbsy-hRyB4R2eMgr6WOyOIdgSPJByf)

Tyler, Palmer, and I went outside at about 10am to do yard work.  Tyler cut the grass, I trimmed, and Palmer raked grass clippings. I made the kids Ramen noodles and miso soup for lunch.  Lachelle woke up at around 12:30pm.  I played with Palmer and Harper outside for a little bit.  When the kids went back inside, I painted the white trim on the garage and the white parts of the front steps.  I helped Palmer and Harper make pizza for dinner.

### 4/5/2020
IPalmer woke me up around 8:30am this morning and I finally got up by 9am.  I made pancakes with him and Harper since it was Sunday. We played off an on until lunch time.  I washed my car right befor lunch (prep. for sale).  I made HArper noodles and Palmer a PB&J for lunch.  In the afternoon, Plamer asked me to teach him how to skateboard so I spent about an hour outside showing him and going back and forth with easy tricks.  L sat in the basement with Disney movies playing crying off and on.  Harper watched TV in the sun room and played on the toy 4 wheeler.  Tyler stayed mostly in his room and the sun room playing tag with Palmer and Harper.  I ordered Paisanos sandwiches for dinner.

### 4/6/2020
Lachelle asked to speak to me around 9:30-10:00am.  She asked if I had found a lawyer so that she could review settlement documents this week while she was on leave from work.  I reminded her that on the evening of 3/15 I asked her if she would be willing to review documents and make edits so that we could work through the settlement process together and only go back to lawyers for items/issues where we firmly disagreed, and she said no and insisted on going through the mediation process.  I asked her if she remembered this, she said no.  I told her I didn't want to work directly with her on anything at the moment and that I had my own priorities to deal with this week.  I asked her to leave the office out of respect for the distance that was mutually agreed upon. She said no, not until I gave her the name of my lawyer.  I told her that I have not formally retained a lawyer, am close to doing so, and I would give her the name eventually.  We went back and forth for 10 more minutes and then I got up and left as she screamed that I was walking away while she was talking to me.  I went upstairs, then outside.

### 4/7/2020
I woke up at 5 am since Palmer woke up early. I made Harper and Palmer lunch, then left at 1:15 to get my estate planning documents notarized and vehicle sale appraisals.  When I came back home at about 3:30p, I played with Palmer outside on his bike (me on skateboard), and played baseball.  At about 4pm I played the pie face game with Harper and Palmer.  I ate dinner at about 5pm and supervised Harper warming up her leftovers (pizza), since she was eating early because she had two (2) zoom classes.  I made Palmer's dinner at 6:00pm after playing floor hockey with him in th basement.  I played pie face with Tyler, Harper, and Palmer at 8:15.  We  had Harper's friend on video chat while we were playing.  We played for about 20 minutes.  Then I went back to my office/bedroom.  Lachelle came downstairs and said she needed to go for a drive, and that she was trying to communicate better.  She said she needed to drive because she felt like she needed to go somewhere, and would be back in about 2 hours.  She then asked for the keys to the Nissan ( my SUV). I told her I didn'twant her to drive my vehicle because I didn't trust her and I wanted my vehicle to stay sanitized.  She said she still had her headlight out, I offered to change it, but she wouldn't let me.  I reminded her that either a week or two weeks ago that she said she was going out to fix it (obviously didn't happen).

[Normal arrival]()

### 4/8/2020
I woke up at 8:30 am and made Palmer and Harper eggs and ham.  Lachelle came through the kitchen and I told her I didn't want to engage in small talk.  It was 80 degrees early in the morning so I went outside to play with Palmer on his bike (me on skateboard), and play baseball.  I made all the kids microwave pizza and green beans for dinner.  Each had ice cream and then went to watch an evening movie.  I ran Palmer's bath water and made bubbles for him.

### 4/9/2020
I woke up at 9am this morning and was followed by Palmer shortly thereafter.  We went upstairs and then came back to the basement, deciding we wer not hungry at the moment.  At around 11 am , I made Palmer an egg, toast with jelly, and Rice Krispies cereal.  Around noon Lachelle came through the kitchen and asked if I was ready to look at and discuss separation agreement items.  I told her that I didn't have confidence that she would remember what we discussed and I didn't want to waste my time.  I told her that I still had other items that I was working on completing, and that was my priority; then I would like some down time to relax before I go back to work.  I told her that I would appreciate it if she would just leave me alone until she contacted lawyers/mediators and obtained their rates and retainer fees (according to our last discusseionon the 7th).  I also asked her why she paused her phone service (so no one could call her).  I went back down to the office.  Sometime later, I called Lachelle's mother from the house phone to let her know that her daughter changed her phone service and then paused her phone line (appears to be disconnected when you call it), and if she needed to reach the kids or me, she could use the house phone (only 2 relatives have the house number) or my number.  I just wanted it to be clear that this was not something I did.  I read nost of the afternoon, while the kids watched a movie and played.  It was cold outside, so they only went out once for about 30-40 minutes to play on the tumble track.  I made Harper and Palmer rice and beans for dinner.  The had ice cream and whip cream for desert.    We played the game pie face after dinner.  Palmer went to sleep at his regular time (before the Coronavirus stay-at-home order) of 8:30pm.


### 4/10/2020
I woke up at 8am.  At about 10am all the kids and I went for a drive to Starbucks and got breakfast, then we drove through DC and through National Harbor before returning home.  We returned around noon and Harper road her bike.  I setup a paint station for Palmer so that he could paint a picture (like the canvas Harper made the day before).

### 4/11/2020
I woke up at 9:30am and Palmer and Harper shortly thereafter.  I helped Harper make toast and Palmer ate yogurt.   Harper went outside to ride her bike early in the morning since she got dressed as soon as she woke up.  Palmer went outside about an hour later to play on his bike, play hop-scotch, and run on the tumble track.  I woke Tyler up at 10:30am so he wouldn't sleep too late. For lunch I made Harper miso soup and noodles, and Palmer PBJ with apple slices.  At 12:30 I went upstair in the kitchen to get some chips, and Lachelle walked in and asked me "are we going to be ok."  I told her that it was not respectful for her to approach me at this time of night to try to have a conversation of that type.  She yelled at me stating, "why can't you just be in the moment?"  I was finished putting some chips on a saucer, so I went back downstairs to the office.

### 4/12/2020
I woke up at 9am and made Palmer and Harper oatmeal.  The kids played all over the house, while I cut my hair.  I washed Palmer and Harper's clothes and folded them (since their laundry baskets were full).  At 11:47 I was hungry so I made breakfast burritos for Harper, Tyler and I.  I made Palmer a egg bagel with carrot sticks for lunch. 

### 4/13/2020
I woke up at 8:30am and made coffee.  Palmer woke-up at about 9am and Harper 9:30am. At about 10:30 I made breakfast burritos for all the kids.  There were intermittent rain showers (heavy) all day, so no one spent much time outside. 

### 4/14/2020
I woke up at 4:30am to place a grocery order for Aldi-Instacart delivery on Wednesday. I left for work at about 5:30am and returned at 5pm.  I brought home leftover lunch which Harper ate for dinner.  Lachelle cooked for Palmer and Tyler. I put Palmer to bed and eventually went to sleep at about 11:30pm. 

### 4/15/2020
I woke up at 5:30am to go to work.  I returned home at 3pm.  The kids were outside playing and were just about done, so I made them a snack as soon as I got home.  I was trying to help Harper connect to her dance lesson (via Zoom) from about 3:15 to 3:45 due to connectivity issues.  She ended up missing most of the first one, but had another session at 4:45pm.  I played Jenga with Tyler and Palmer for a little bit after Harper got in her class.  At about 5:45 Palmer said he was hungry, so I went upstairs to make all of the kids dinner.  Lachelle said she was going to get Popeyes for dinner for them for her Birthday.  I went downstairs and played more Jenga with Tyler and Palmer until Lachelle returned.  I stayed in the office for Lachelle's b-day with the kids (while they ate dinner, sang Happy Birthday song, and ate cup cakes).  Later in the evening I played Monopoly with Palmer until 9pm, when I setup the shower for him so that he could get ready for bed.  Afterwards, I made popcorn and Harper and I ate it while watching some science show in the office until about 1030pm, when it was Harper's bedtime.  I told Harper and Tyler goodnight and went to bed shortly after 1030pm.

### 4/16/2020
I woke up at 7:30 and went to work.  I returned home at about 4pm.

### 4/17/2020
I woke up at 8am and made Harper an eggs and toast (she asked me to do that the night before, even if I left for work early).  I retruned home at about 4:30pm, where the kids were playing outside.  Since they were supposed to play outside for about and hour, I took a quick shower and then prepared Harper and Palmer's dinner (leftover chicken and wild rice soup).  After dinner I made a microwave cupcake for Palmer since he kept asking me for one (we actually made 4, HArper and ate one too).

### 4/18/2020
Palmer woke me up at about 9am so I went upstairs to make the batter for waffles.  I made waffles and bacon for the kids breakfast and then went down stairs to play Jenga with Palmer.  Afterwards, Palmer, Harper, and I watcht a Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie and played hide and go seek for a while.  Lachelle made lunck for the  kids.  I  played of and on, while watching portions of movies and going outside.  I fixed Palmer and Harper dinner (rice, brocolli, & sweer potatoes).  I ran Palmer's bath water and stayed upstairs to supervise him while he played with bath toys. Around midnight, Lachelle came downstairs and cracked my door open and started peaking in.  I ignored it for about 2 minutes, then I got up to close the door.  She ran (playing like a little kid) into Tyler's room, slammed doors behind hrhere and hid.  I went to Tyler's room (stopping at the door) to ask him if she was still hiding in there and he confirmed it.  I turned around to go upstairs to the kitchend to get chips.  She followed me, while I avoided eye contact.  When I went back downstairs she sais something... and kept following me.  I went into the office and pulled a storage drawer and desk in front of the door so that it couldn't be opened.  She  said she wanted to talk, I told her no, we could talk at another time.  I should have made a video of this crap, so everyone could see how ridiculous putting up with her behavior is.  Wow, this is so frustrating!  I wish this I could move forward, what ever that looks like where she is not around me at all anymore.

### 4/19/2020
I woke up at 8am.    Lachelle made dinner for the kids.

### 4/20/2020
I woke up at 7:30 and helped Harper get her breakfast,then I left for work.  I made dinner for Palmer and Harper (rice and mixed vegetables).  After dinner Harper, Palmer and I made microwave chocolate cupcakes from scratch.   I then watched the movie 'Mirror Mirror' with Harper.  After the movie was over I gave Palmer a bath.

### 4/21/2020
I woke up at 4:00am anf got ready to go to work.  

### 4/23/2020
I woke up at 7:00am and got ready to go to work.  I returned home at ~ 3:00pm and played hide and seek with Harper and Palmer.  I made a salad for dinner and cooked a pizza at about 4:30pm since I was hungry.

### 4/24/2020
I woke up at 7:00am and got ready to go to work.  This week went by fast, I thought today was Saturday.  I borugh two 18" pizzas home for dinner, that the kids ate with the leftover salad from the night before.  They had watermelon and cupcakes for dinner.  I played pool with Harper after dinner.

### 4/25/2020
I woke up at 9:00am and made pancakes and bacon for the kids (since Palmer asked the night before).  I played off and on with Harper and Palmer and watched various shows and movies.  At about noon we went outside and played for about an hour.  I showed Tyler how to use the oven, and he warmed chicken nuggets for dinner around 5pm.

### 4/26/2020
I woke up at around 8:30am and made Palmer a bagel while I was getting food and coffee. Harper woke up about 30 minutes later, so I made her oatmeal.  I played off and on with Harper and Palmer and watched various shows and movies.  At about noon we went outside and played for about an hour.  Tyler made turkey chilli for dinner with guidance.

### 4/27/2020
I woke up at around 5am and got ready to go to work.  I returned home at about 3:30pm.  I played soccer with PAlmer and Harper and then pool later that evening with Palmer and Tyler.  Lachelle made spaghetti for kids dinner. 

### 4/28/2020
I woke up at around 5:30am and got ready to go to work.  I returned home at about 3:30pm.  I made chocolate chip cookies with Palmer and Harper before dinner since we were bored and Harper had some time before her next dance class.   I made Palmer dinner, Lachelle fixed Harper's dinner.  Lachelle and I got into an argument later and had back and forths for most of the evening until about 10:30 when I went to sleep.

### 4/29/2020
I woke up at5:30am with my back hurting so bad.  I  got dressed slowly and went to work.  I returned home at 3pm.  Since the kids were all engaged in their activities I laid down (on my back, the only way it didn't hur) until about 4:30pm.  Lachelle got the kids dinner ready. After dinner, I tried to play a few games of pool with Tyler and Palmer, but that didn't go well.  I had Palmer get ready for bed at 8pm instead of 8:30pm because I was planning on going to bed early.  I laid down shortly thereafter for about an hour and woke up.  Lachelle came down into the office and asked me if I hated her.  I told her that I would prefer if we scheduled a time once a week to talk about our stuff, and that she was violating the only space I have left to myself since I did not invite her in the room.  She went a head and asked me three more times and I reiterated that I would prefer not to discusss this at the current time. I ended up staying awake until about 12:30pm, when I was able to go back to sleep.

### 4/30/2020
I woke up at 6am and went to work, my back felt slightly better, but still pain...  I put together a breakdown of household expense that I felt Lachelle should contribute to based on a conversation we had two nights ago.  I sent her an email with this message, "The amount in bold is half of the applicable expenses (this does NOT include the VW car insurance amount / mthly, children's medical/dental insurance or fees, or any charge to a credit card).
$1,639.22 monthly." This represents half (even excluding other expenses that should be added) of the household living expenses, and it is under $20,000 a year.  She said she can't afford that, I think it is pathetic that after 14 years of marriage where all I asked her to do was consistently contribute to one (1) utility bill / she couldn't or wouldn't...as an adult, she needs to do better.

## May 2020
### 5/1/2020
I woke up at 5am and went to work.  I returned home at 12:45pm and bought two pizzas, a salad, cookies, a brownie, and a canoli for lunch.  The weather was great, so I came home early to spend some time outside with the kids.  We played off and on all afternoon, and in the evening they made a fort in the basement.  

### 5/2/2020
I woke up at 8:30am and made Palmer and Harper oatmeal with brown sugar and cinnamon.I made waffle breakfast sandwichs for lunch (since I wanted waffles).  Afterwards, I mowed the back yard and swept the patio.  The kids and I played hide and seek for a while then I went back inside while they played.  I order takeout from the Pho restaurant around the corner (we usually have it about once a month) since we haven't had it in 3-4 months.

### 5/3/2020
I woke up at 7am. Harper and Palmer finally woke-up at 9am.  It rained all morning, so Harper and I played around the house.  At noon we made chocolate chip cookies using the Hilton recipe.  Harper, Palmer, and I bounced around each room, playing Xbox, PC games, watching shows/movies all afternoon.  

### 5/4/2020
I woke up at 6am and went to work.  I returned home at about 3:30pm and wandered around the house since all the kids were engaged in their school work (nice).  At about 4:45pm I made dinner for all the kids and myself (rice, spanish style beans, and grilled seasoned cabbage). The kids had pie for dessert. Harper and Palmer piled into the office with me afterwards for most of the evening to watch shows and do arts and crafts (Mother's Day gifts).

### 5/5/2020
I woke up at 6am and left for work.  I arrived back home at 4:30pm.  Lachelle already made dinner for the kids so I fixed Palmer and Harper's plates so they could eat before Harper's 6pm dance class. I ran Palmer's bath water and made bubbles while Lachelle mad his bed. I supervised Palmer (mostly playing) while taking his bath.  Afterwards, Palmer and I played a game until bedtime.

### 5/6/2020
I woke up at 8:30am and made oatmeal for Harper and Palmer.  At 9:15am I woke Tyler up and asked him about their daily school schedule, as a few weeks ago everyone was up by 8:30am - then they would eat breakfast and login to their online classrooms.  Tyler told me that school starts whenever their Mommy wakes up.  So... I left for work at 9:25am.  I returned home at about 4:30pm and checked to see what everyone was working on. Since they were all doing work (or had completed it), I decided to do laundry.  I ordered burgers and salads for me and the kids.

### 5/7/2020
I woke up at 5:30am and went to work. I arrived back home at 4pm.  Lachelle made dinner for the kids at around 6pm.

### 5/8/2020
I woke up at 5:30am and went to work.  I brought two pizzas and two subs home for dinner.

### 5/9/2020
Palmer and I woke up at about 8:15am, he hung around the kitchen while I made pancakes and eggs. Harper wokk up around 9am and Tyler around 10am.  I made sure everyone had breakfast / brunch.  We played downstairs and in the sunroom most of the day, since it was cold outside.  We spent about 1 hour outside later in the day, hoping that the temperature would rise some.  For dinner, I fixed the kids plates (leftovers mostly).  

### 5/10/2020
Literally, the same as Saturday except I barbequed ribs, chicken, and hot dogs outside  since the kids asked me.

### 5/11/2020
I woke up at 7am and got dressed for work, leaving around 7:30 (after I got Palmer breakfast).  I picked up groceries at 4:30pm before heading home. The kids ate leftover barbeque  for dinner.  After dinner, I played outside with Harper and Palmer.

### 5/12/2020
I woke up at 5am and got dressed for work, leaving around 5:30.  I returned home at about 3:45pm.  Between 4:40 - 5pm I made Harper and Palmer's dinner (macaroni & cheese, green beans, and chicken) since they wer both hungry.  Harper had three zoom classes this afternoon, so I helped her with technical problems after the first one was over.  I then went outside and repaired holes in the soccer goal's netting.  Palmer and I then played soccer for about 20 minutes before we went back inside.  I spoke to Tyler about switching rooms and he was eager to do so (he felt his existing room has too much space and it is difficult to decorate). So Tyler and I talked and made a rough diagram about how to arrange furniture in his new room.  I got ready for bed at 10pm.

### 5/17/2020
I made Palmer oatmeal with strawberries and Harper grits with a sunny-side up egg on top for breakfast (Sat. and Sun.).  I  told the  kids that I was putting the electronic devices back on a time restriction Sunday' since they have all been slowly slipping from there schedule during the quarantine effort (it is important to maintain a healthy routine to keep the mental sanity during times of increased stress!).  

### 5/18/2020
I woke up at 4:54 am after sleeping on the couch (I put Tyler's bed back together for him).  We were going to switch rooms this weekend, but I didn't feel like moving that much furniture between the two of us. I left for work at about 5:30 and got dressed for work, leaving around 7:45am.

### 5/19/2020
I woke up at 8:30 and stayed at home today.  At about 9:15 I helped Harper prepare her breakfast.  The kids sat at the kitchen table doing their school work until about 12:15pm, when they ate lunch.  They went back to school work after lunch but were pretty much done by 2pm.  Harper and I went for a walk around the neighborhood at about 2:15pm so that I could get some more steps in (3,000 steps since my daily target is 10,000).  Palmer and packed away the toy car race track after Harper and I returned from the walk, so Harper could get ready for her dance class at 3:15 (via zoom).  Lachelle made something for dinner for the kids, while I ordered 2 pizzas & 3 subs from Paisano's later that evening (for dinner and lunch the next day).  At around 11pm Lachelle was doing laundry, she opened the office door to try and engage in small talk.  I asked her what she was doing, and she said "lighten up, I was just trying playing."  I told her I don't ever want to "play with her," close the door.  She replied, well I guess I'm a horrible person." I didn't say anything to her and continued to look out the side of my eye at the door knob (she saw me... and finaly closed the door).  She is deranged... has no consideration for consequences of actions and personal responsibility.  I don't think she is a fully functioning adult.  

### 5/20/2020
I woke up at 5:30 and went to work.  I arrived back home at about 2:30pm. The kids had just finished their school work. I went to the office to work for about 2  more hours.  I then played twister, jumped rope, and bean bag toss with Palmer and Tyler until 5:30pm.  I then went upstairs to fix Harper and Palmer's dinner.  Tyler fixed his own plate and ate at about 6:30p.  Lachelle had a crazy attitude all afternoon (since I don't speak to her unless it is about the kids, she was still trying to initiate conversations with me), but was distinctly short in attitude and loud in voice.  I mostly avoided her for the rest of the afternoon.

### 5/21/2020
I woke up at 5:30 and went to work.

### 5/23/2020
I woke up at 5pm and drove to Blacksburg to play the Va Tech / River golf course.  When I arrived, the course was closed because of flooding so I drove back home.  I got back at about 4:30 pm and hung out with the kids.

### 5/25/2020
I woke up at 5:30 am played 18 holes and returned home at 10:05 am...yes!   I made Harper and Palmer more food since they asked for a snack when I got home.  

### 5/27/2020
I woke up at 5:30 am and went to work and returned home at 2:30pm.  I printed some coloring templates for Palmer so that we could make some 'villan' templates so he could play with his action templates.  I played with Palmer while Harper was doing her Zoom dance class. At about 5:30 pm I made a salad, cooked pizza, and made 3 plates for the kids dinner.  

### 5/28/2020
I woke up at 5:30 and went to work.   I picked up Chik-Fil-A sandwiches and waffle fries for dinner.  

### 5/29/2020
I woke up at 5:30 and went to work.  I went to the grocery store in the middle of the day to get milk and bread.   I went by Vocelli's after work to bring home dinner and lunch for Sat.

### 5/30/2020
I woke up and trimmed the yard.  I then supervised Tyler cutting the front lawn while Palmer played outside.  I cleaned the weeds out of the side lawn while showing Harper how to plant a tomato plant.  I let her pick the spot and she dug the hole.  We went inside afterwards to break for lunch.  I took out the mini-pools and filled them up so Palmer and Harper could play in the water.  The kids ate leftovers for dinner.

### 5/31/2020
Palmer and I woke up at 7am.  I made his breakfast while I made coffee. We then went downstairs to the office until I had to leave at 9am to go to the golf tournament.  I got home at 3:30pm and played with the kids some before getting dinner from Busboy Poets.

## June 2020
### 6/1/2020
I went to work at 5:30am, returned home at 2:45pm.  I read a book to Palmer and we played volleybal for most of the afternoon.  Harper built a fort upstairs and spent most of the afternoon between her room and the fort.  The kids ate leftovers for dinner.

### 6/2/2020
I went to work at 7:45am after getting Palmer breakfast.  I haven't actually slept in a bed for 3 months.  I came home at about 4:30 and watched a show with Harper since her dance class was cancelled for today. Afterwards, I played with Palmer as he built and re-built tracks for toy cars and trucks.  Lachelle made the kids dinner (Palmer and her mad breaded chicken bites). 

### 6/3/2020
I went to work at 5:45am.  Lachelle had 4 bottles of win delivered today... the drowning continues.
